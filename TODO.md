# TODO: Make Chat Bubbles Cute with Gradient Colors

- [x] Update src/app/page.tsx: Replace solid backgrounds with gradient classes (e.g., blue-to-purple for user, gray-to-teal for AI), add cute elements like increased border-radius, bounce animation, and emojis (ðŸ˜Š for user, ðŸ¤– for AI).
- [x] Edit src/app/globals.css if custom gradients are needed beyond Tailwind.
- [x] Test the app locally to verify gradients and cute elements render correctly.
- [ ] Verify responsiveness and accessibility (e.g., text contrast on gradients).
